{"name":"Da esa wkshp","tagline":"eoldas_ng distribution for ESA Land DA workshop at UCL","body":"ESA Land DA workshop\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nThis repository contains material and instructions for the ESA Land DA workshop that will take place at University College London on Mar 31/Apr 1 2014.\r\n\r\nTo install the required Python modules\r\n*****************************************\r\n\r\nWe assume that you have numpy, scipy and matplotlib already installed (you can try Anaconda python to install the whole Python stack). Then, issue the following commands:\r\n\r\n````\r\n   pip install ~/SHARED/GomezDans/eoldas_ng-0.1.tar.gz \\\r\n               --user --upgrade\r\n   pip install ~/SHARED/GomezDans/prosail_fortran-1.1.0.tar.gz \\\r\n               --user --upgrade\r\n   pip install ~/SHARED/GomezDans/gp_emulator-1.2.tar.gz \\\r\n               --user --upgrade\r\n   ~/SHARED/GomezDans/test.py\r\n   mkdir eoldas_tutorial\r\n   cp ~/SHARED/GomezDans/*.txt eoldas_tutorial/\r\n   cp ~/SHARED/GomezDans/*ipynb eoldas_tutorial/\r\n   cp ~/SHARED/GomezDans/*.npz eoldas_tutorial/\r\n   cd eoldas_tutorial\r\n   ipython notebook \r\n   #\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can probably just copy and paste those lines into an UNIX terminal. Note that these commands will only work if you have an account on the UCL system, and an account with an username like `daesaXX`, where `XX` are two digits. In case you don't have that, you can get hold of the required packages by cloning the current repository with git, changing to that directory and issuing the following commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   pip install ./eoldas_ng-0.1.tar.gz --user --upgrade\r\n   pip install ./prosail_fortran-1.1.0.tar.gz --user --upgrade\r\n   pip install ./gp_emulator-1.2.tar.gz --user --upgrade\r\n   ./GomezDans/test.py\r\n```\r\nAny issues or comments, add an issue here on github, or send me an email on `j.gomez-dans@ucl.ac.uk`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
